## I am *tinesime*, a passionate software developer based in Graz, Austria.

I am a highly motivated web developer based in Graz, Austria, with a deep passion for technology and a relentless drive
to change the world for the better. My journey with coding began in childhood, where I was captivated by the endless
possibilities of programming. As a self-taught developer, I’ve built a strong foundation in web development and
continually expand my knowledge in computer science to stay ahead in an ever-evolving industry.

Currently, I am working as a junior web developer and also pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of
Technology in Graz. Beyond web development, I am deeply interested in machine learning, data science, and
cybersecurity—fields that I
believe will shape the future of technology. I am excited by the potential of these disciplines to transform industries
and improve lives, and I am committed to continuously learning and exploring these areas.

With a dedication to continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration, I thrive on tackling challenges and
working with like-minded professionals. Whether it’s mastering new technologies, improving existing systems, or
exploring innovative concepts, I am always eager to grow and contribute meaningfully to any team I’m part of.

With a passion for innovation and an unwavering commitment to excellence, I am ready to take on the next challenge and
push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of computer science and beyond.
